## STTStream.testHeaders() method

Test if headers of WAV file are correct

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
testHeaders(): Promise<[boolean, boolean, WavHeaders]>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;\[boolean, boolean, [WavHeaders](./transcribe-stt.wavheaders.md)<!-- -->\]&gt;

If encoding was correct, if sample rate was correct, and the headers of the WAV file

## Remarks

This method does not test encodings perfectly as many encodings go by multiples aliases. For example, "LINEAR16" is often listed in headers as "Microsoft PCM 16 bit".

Because of this, [STTStream.testHeaders()](./transcribe-stt.sttstream.testheaders.md) does not have to pass for [STTStream.start()](./transcribe-stt.sttstream.start.md) to pass.

If you find an alias of an encoding that causes [STTStream.testHeaders()](./transcribe-stt.sttstream.testheaders.md) to throw a false error, please leave an issue about it in the GitHub repo

## Example

This example checks if the headers you passed to [STTStream](./transcribe-stt.sttstream.md) are correct and logs them. This can be helpful when you don't know what headers your WAV file has.

See [STTStream](./transcribe-stt.sttstream.md) to instantiate the stream

```ts
// ...

// Test headers
const [goodEncoding, goodSampleRate, headers] = await stream.testHeaders();

// Log results
console.log("File has correct encoding?", goodEncoding);
console.log("File has correct sample rate?", goodSampleRate);

// Log headers
console.log("File has encoding:", headers.encoding);
console.log("File has sample rate:", headers.sampleRateHertz);

```
